# Summary

A 3D Slicer [@Fedorov2012] extension for ultrasound scan conversion during 2D
and 3D image generation for traditional B-mode imaging [@McCormick2010], but
also next-generation ultrasound image modalities like ultrasound spectroscopy
[@Aylward2016], acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI) [@Palmeri2016],
acoustic radiation force shear wave imaging (ARFI-SWEI) [@Rosenzweig2014], and
others.  Interfaces are built off the ITKUltrasound library [@McCormick2014].
