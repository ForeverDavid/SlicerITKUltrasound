	abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

	title = {Ultrasound spectroscopy},
	doi = {10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493437},
	abstract = {We introduce the concept of "Ultrasound Spectroscopy". The premise of ultrasound spectroscopy is that by acquiring ultrasound RF data at multiple power and frequency settings, a rich set of features can be extracted from that RF data and used to characterize the underlying tissues. This is beneficial for a variety of problems, such as accurate tissue classification, application-specific image generation, and numerous other quantitative tasks. These capabilities are particularly relevant to point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications, where operator experience with ultrasound may be limited. Instead of displaying B-mode images, a POCUS application using ultrasound spectroscopy can, for example, automatically detect internal abdominal bleeding. In this paper, we present ex vivo tissue phantom studies to demonstrate the accuracy of ultrasound spectroscopy over previous approaches. Our studies suggest that ultrasound spectroscopy provides exceptional accuracy and informative features for classifying blood versus other tissues across image locations and body habitus.},

	abstract = {A variety of advanced image analysis methods have been under the development for ultrasound-guided interventions. Unfortunately, the transition from an image analysis algorithm to clinical feasibility trials as part of an intervention system requires integration of many components, such as imaging and tracking devices, data processing algorithms, and visualization software. The objective of our paper is to provide a freely available open-source software platform-PLUS: Public software Library for Ultrasound-to facilitate rapid prototyping of ultrasound-guided intervention systems for translational clinical research. PLUS provides a variety of methods for interventional tool pose and ultrasound image acquisition from a wide range of tracking and imaging devices, spatial and temporal calibration, volume reconstruction, simulated image generation, and recording and live streaming of the acquired data. This paper introduces PLUS, explains its functionality and architecture, and presents typical uses and performance in ultrasound-guided intervention systems. PLUS fulfills the essential requirements for the development of ultrasound-guided intervention systems and it aspires to become a widely used translational research prototyping platform.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility verification is essential to the practice of the scientific method. Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature.Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification.This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84\% code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads. The median normalized closeness centrality, a measure of knowledge flow, resulting from the distributed peer code review system was high, 0.46.},

	title = {Comparison between 3D {ARFI} imaging and {mpMRI} in detecting clinically-significant prostate cancer lesions},
	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728618},
	abstract = {Current prostate cancer screening methods involve non-targeted needle biopsies and detection of clinically-insignificant lesions that receive excessive treatments, exposing patients to unnecessary adverse side effects and placing a burden on our health care systems. There is a strong clinical need for improved prostate imaging methods that are sensitive and specific for clinically-significant prostate cancer lesions to guide needle biopsies, target focal treatments, and improve overall patient outcomes. In this study, we compared 3D in vivo Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging with 3 Tesla, endorectal coil, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to correlate the ability for each modality to identify clinically-significant prostate cancer lesions. We also correlated Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values from Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) MR sequences with ARFI indices of suspicion and MR Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data Systems (PI-RADS) scores, testing the hypothesis that increased cellular density is associated with regions suspicious for prostate cancer in ARFI images. Overall, ARFI and mpMR imaging were well-correlated in identifying clinically-significant prostate cancer lesions. There were several cases where only one of the imaging modalities was able to identify the prostate cancer lesion, highlighting the potential to further improve prostate cancer lesion detection and localization with a fused ARFI:mpMRI imaging system. ADC values were decreased in all prostate cancer lesions identified with mpMRI, but there were no obvious trends between the absolute ADC values and the ARFI image indices of suspicion.},
